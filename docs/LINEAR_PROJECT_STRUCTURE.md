## 1. Executive Summary

### Current Platform State

| Category | Status | Issues |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **Critical Blockers** | BLOCKING | 5 issues |
| **High Priority** | Pre-Beta | 6 issues |
| **Medium Priority** | Post-Beta | 8 issues |
| **Code Duplication** | Tech Debt | 4 issues |
| **Testing Gaps** | Quality | 5 issues |
| **Feature Incomplete** | MVP | 6 issues |
| **Total** | | ~34 issues |

### Key Principles

1. **No Time Estimates** - Focus on dependencies, complexity, and completion
2. **Clear Dependency Chains** - Every issue documents what it blocks and is blocked by
3. **Actionable Issues** - Each issue completable by a single AI agent session
4. **Trackable Progress** - Visual MVP progress through milestones
5. **Right-Sized Scope** - Issues are 2-8 complexity points (not too big, not too small)

## 4. Issue Hierarchy

### Parent/Child Structure

Linear supports three levels of issue hierarchy:

```
Epic (Parent Issue)
├── Task (Child Issue)
│   └── Sub-task (Sub-issue)
└── Task (Child Issue)
    └── Sub-task (Sub-issue)
```

### When to Use Each Level

| Level | Use Case | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Epic** | Major work stream, 5+ related tasks | "Fix Database Security" |
| **Task** | Single deliverable, 1-4 hour work | "Enable RLS on bingo_templates" |
| **Sub-task** | Atomic step within task | "Write RLS policy for SELECT" |

### Dependency Types

| Relationship | Meaning | Example |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| **Blocks** | Must complete before | CRIT-1 blocks CRIT-3 |
| **Blocked By** | Cannot start until | CRIT-3 blocked by CRIT-1 |
| **Related** | Contextually connected | CRIT-1 related to CRIT-2 |
| **Duplicate** | Same issue | Merge into one |

### Issue Dependency Graph

```
CRITICAL PATH (Sequential):
CRIT-1 ─→ CRIT-3 ─→ HIGH-1 ─→ Feature Completion

### Label Application Rules

1. **Every issue MUST have:** severity + type + at least one component
2. **Complexity labels:** Apply after scope is understood
3. **Status labels:** Updated by workflow automations
4. **Multiple components:** Apply all relevant (e.g., `app:bingo` + `pkg:sync`)

### Creating Labels via Linear MCP

```bash
# Using Claude Code with Linear MCP
"Create a label 'severity:critical' with red color #E11D48 for the BEA team"
```

---

## 7. Priority Schema

### Priority Levels

Linear has 5 priority levels:

| Priority | Level | Meaning | Use For |
|----------|-------|---------|---------|
| Urgent | P0 | Do immediately | Security vulnerabilities, production down |
| High | P1 | Do this cycle | Blocking issues, beta requirements |
| Medium | P2 | Do soon | Quality improvements, tech debt |
| Low | P3 | Backlog | Nice to have, future features |
| No Priority | - | Unprioritized | New issues awaiting triage |

### Severity to Priority Mapping

| Severity | Default Priority | Can Escalate To |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| Critical | Urgent (P0) | N/A (already highest) |
| High | High (P1) | Urgent if blocking |
| Medium | Medium (P2) | High if dependency |
| Low | Low (P3) | Medium if grouped |

### Dependency-Based Prioritization

Issues that block multiple other issues get priority bumps:

```
Blocks 0 issues → Base priority
Blocks 1-2 issues → +1 priority level
Blocks 3+ issues → +2 priority levels (max Urgent)
```

**Example:**
- CRIT-1 (RLS) blocks CRIT-3, Task 1, Task 2 → Urgent (already critical)
- HIGH-4 (CORS) blocks nothing → High (standard)
- MED-2 (Toast IDs) blocks nothing → Medium (standard)

### Priority Queries in Linear

```
# Find all urgent/critical work
priority:urgent OR (label:severity:critical)

# Find blocking issues
has:blocks

# Find blocked issues
has:blockedBy state:!completed
```

## 8. Concrete Issue Examples

### Example 1: Critical Security Issue

```yaml
Issue ID: CRIT-1
Title: Enable Row Level Security on bingo_templates table
Project: Security Remediation
Type: Bug/Security
Severity: Critical
Priority: Urgent (P0)
Component: db:supabase, app:bingo
Complexity: Medium (3 points)

Description: |
  ## Problem
  Row Level Security (RLS) is disabled on the `bingo_templates` table,
  allowing any user to read, modify, or delete any template.

  ## Impact
  - Data exposure: Any user can read all templates
  - Data tampering: Any user can modify any template
  - Data loss: Any user can delete any template

  ## Root Cause
  RLS was disabled during development and never re-enabled.

  ## Solution
  1. Enable RLS on table
  2. Create 4 RLS policies (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
  3. Verify with test queries

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  - [ ] `SELECT rowsecurity FROM pg_tables WHERE tablename = 'bingo_templates'` returns `true`
  - [ ] 4 policies exist in `pg_policies`
  - [ ] Unauthenticated users cannot read templates
  - [ ] Users can only access their own templates
  - [ ] Existing templates remain accessible to owners

  ## Verification Commands
  ```sql
  -- Test 1: RLS enabled
  SELECT rowsecurity FROM pg_tables WHERE tablename = 'bingo_templates';
  -- Expected: true

  -- Test 2: Unauthorized access denied
  SET ROLE anon;
  SELECT * FROM bingo_templates;
  -- Expected: 0 rows
  ```

### Example 2: Test Failure Issue

```yaml
Issue ID: CRIT-4
Title: Fix 27 failing Bingo tests (create-new-game, TemplateSelector, page.test, offline-mode)
Project: Test Fixes
Type: Bug/Test
Severity: Critical
Priority: Urgent (P0)
Component: app:bingo
Complexity: Medium (4 points)

Description: |
  ## Problem
  27 tests are failing in the Bingo app, blocking merge and deployment.

  ## Failing Test Groups
  | Test File | Failures | Root Cause |
  |-----------|----------|------------|
  | create-new-game tests | 8 | Mock fetch returns undefined |
  | TemplateSelector tests | ~10 | Missing Response.ok mock |
  | page.test tests | ~5 | Async rendering issues |
  | offline-mode tests | ~4 | Storage mock incomplete |

  ## Root Cause Analysis
  Mock fetch implementations return `undefined` instead of proper
  `Response` objects with `.ok` and `.json()` methods.

  ## Solution
  1. Fix mock fetch to return proper Response objects
  2. Add null checks for response objects
  3. Ensure async operations complete before assertions
  4. Fix storage mock for offline mode tests

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  - [ ] `pnpm test:run` in apps/bingo passes
  - [ ] 0 failing tests
  - [ ] 0 skipped tests
  - [ ] Coverage unchanged or improved

  ## Verification Commands
  ```bash
  cd apps/bingo
  pnpm test:run
  # Expected: All tests pass

  pnpm test:coverage
  # Expected: 80%+ line coverage
  ```

Blocks:
  - Feature completion work
  - Deployment pipeline

Blocked By:
  - None

### Example 3: Code Duplication Issue

```yaml
Issue ID: MED-1
Title: Extract duplicate OAuth client code to @joolie-boolie/auth package
Project: Code Consolidation
Type: Tech Debt
Severity: Medium
Priority: Medium (P2)
Component: app:bingo, app:trivia, pkg:auth
Complexity: Medium (4 points)

Description: |
  ## Problem
  Bingo and Trivia apps have identical OAuth client implementations
  (802 lines of duplicate code across both apps).

  ## Duplicate Files
  | Bingo | Trivia | Lines |
  |-------|--------|-------|
  | src/lib/auth/oauth-client.ts | src/lib/auth/oauth-client.ts | ~60 |
  | src/lib/auth/pkce.ts | src/lib/auth/pkce.ts | ~40 |
  | src/lib/auth/token-storage.ts | src/lib/auth/token-storage.ts | ~80 |
  | src/app/auth/callback/page.tsx | src/app/auth/callback/page.tsx | ~120 |
  | src/middleware.ts (auth parts) | src/middleware.ts (auth parts) | ~100 |

  ## Solution
  1. Create `packages/auth/src/oauth-client.ts` with shared code
  2. Parameterize app-specific values (app name, storage keys)
  3. Export from `@joolie-boolie/auth` package
  4. Update Bingo to import from package
  5. Update Trivia to import from package
  6. Delete duplicate files from apps

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  - [ ] Single OAuth client implementation in @joolie-boolie/auth
  - [ ] Bingo imports from @joolie-boolie/auth
  - [ ] Trivia imports from @joolie-boolie/auth
  - [ ] No duplicate auth files in apps
  - [ ] All OAuth tests pass
  - [ ] OAuth flow works end-to-end in both apps

  ## Lines Removed
  ~400 lines removed (keeping one copy)

  ## Verification Commands
  ```bash
  # Verify no duplicate files
  find apps -name "oauth-client.ts" -o -name "pkce.ts"
  # Expected: No results

  # Verify package exports
  grep -r "startOAuthFlow" packages/auth/src/
  # Expected: Function defined in package

  # Verify apps use package
  grep -r "@joolie-boolie/auth" apps/bingo/src/
  grep -r "@joolie-boolie/auth" apps/trivia/src/
  # Expected: Import statements found
  ```

Blocks:

### Example 4: Feature Completion Issue

```yaml
Issue ID: FEAT-1
Title: Implement logout functionality in Bingo and Trivia apps
Project: Feature Completion
Type: Feature
Severity: Medium
Priority: Medium (P2)
Component: app:bingo, app:trivia, app:platform-hub
Complexity: Medium (4 points)

Description: |
  ## Problem
  No logout functionality exists in any app. Users cannot sign out.

  ## Current State
  - No logout buttons in UI
  - No /api/auth/logout routes
  - Sessions persist indefinitely

  ## Solution
  1. Add `/api/auth/logout` route to Bingo
  2. Add `/api/auth/logout` route to Trivia
  3. Add LogoutButton component to presenter UI
  4. Clear cookies (access_token, refresh_token, user_id)
  5. Revoke session on server if applicable
  6. Redirect to home after logout

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  - [ ] Logout button visible in presenter UI (both apps)
  - [ ] Clicking logout clears all auth cookies
  - [ ] User redirected to home page
  - [ ] Subsequent visits require re-authentication
  - [ ] Session revoked on server (if applicable)

  ## Files to Create/Modify
  - `apps/bingo/src/app/api/auth/logout/route.ts` (new)
  - `apps/trivia/src/app/api/auth/logout/route.ts` (new)
  - `apps/bingo/src/components/presenter/LogoutButton.tsx` (new)
  - `apps/trivia/src/components/presenter/LogoutButton.tsx` (new)
  - `apps/bingo/src/app/play/page.tsx` (add button)
  - `apps/trivia/src/app/play/page.tsx` (add button)

  ## Verification Commands
  ```bash
  # Test logout route
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/logout
  # Expected: 200 OK, Set-Cookie headers clearing tokens

  # Verify cookies cleared
  # Check browser dev tools after logout
  # Expected: access_token, refresh_token cookies removed
  ```

### Example 5: Infrastructure Issue

```yaml
Issue ID: CRIT-5
Title: Replace Math.random() with crypto.getRandomValues() for session IDs
Project: Security Remediation
Type: Security
Severity: Critical
Priority: Urgent (P0)
Component: app:bingo
Complexity: Small (2 points)

Description: |
  ## Problem
  `Math.random()` is used to generate offline session IDs in
  `apps/bingo/src/lib/sync/offline-session.ts:34`. This is predictable
  and not suitable for security contexts.

  ## Impact
  - Predictable session IDs
  - Session hijacking possible
  - Higher collision risk

  ## Current Code
  ```typescript
  const char = chars[Math.floor(Math.random() * chars.length)];
  ```

  ## Solution
  ```typescript
  const randomValues = crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint32Array(length));
  let result = '';
  for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    result += chars[randomValues[i] % chars.length];
  }
  return result;
  ```

  ## Note
  PIN generation in `lib/session/secure-generation.ts` correctly uses
  `crypto.getRandomValues()`. Apply same pattern here.

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  - [ ] No `Math.random()` in session/sync code
  - [ ] `crypto.getRandomValues()` used for all ID generation
  - [ ] Existing tests pass
  - [ ] New unit tests for secure generation

  ## Verification Commands
  ```bash
  # Search for Math.random in security-sensitive code
  grep -r "Math.random" apps/*/src/lib/session/
  grep -r "Math.random" apps/*/src/lib/sync/
  # Expected: No results

  # Verify crypto usage
  grep -r "crypto.getRandomValues" apps/*/src/lib/
  # Expected: Found in offline-session.ts
  ```

Blocks:
  - None (parallel work)

Blocked By:
  - None

## 9. Team Workflow

### How AI Agents Should Use Linear

#### Creating Issues

1. **Search first** - Check if similar issue exists
2. **Use templates** - Follow issue template structure
3. **Set all required labels** - severity, type, component
4. **Document dependencies** - blocks/blocked by
5. **Link to docs** - Reference relevant documentation

```
# Example Claude Code command
"Create a Linear issue for fixing RLS on bingo_templates.
It's a critical security bug that blocks test-login removal."
```

#### Updating Issues

1. **When starting work** - Update status to "In Progress"
2. **When blocked** - Add `status:blocked` label, document blocker
3. **When complete** - Update status to "Done", add completion notes
4. **When finding related issues** - Add relationships

```
# Example Claude Code command
"Update issue BEA-123 to In Progress status"
"Mark BEA-123 as blocked by BEA-120"
"Complete issue BEA-123 with note: RLS enabled and verified"
```

#### Tracking Blockers

For blocked issues, document:

1. **What is blocked** - The issue that cannot proceed
2. **Why it's blocked** - The dependency
3. **Resolution path** - What needs to happen
4. **Resolution status** - Progress toward unblocking

```yaml
# Blocked issue comment
Status: BLOCKED
Blocked By: BEA-120 (Enable RLS)
Reason: Cannot remove test-login routes until RLS ensures
        data is protected without them.
Resolution: Complete BEA-120 first, then unblock this issue.
```

#### Representing Code Duplication Work

For deduplication tasks, document:

1. **Duplicate locations** - All files with duplicate code
2. **Lines affected** - Quantify duplication
3. **Target location** - Where consolidated code will live
4. **Migration steps** - How to update consumers

```yaml
# Duplication issue structure
Duplicate Files:
- apps/bingo/src/lib/auth/oauth.ts (60 lines)
- apps/trivia/src/lib/auth/oauth.ts (60 lines)

Consolidation Target:
- packages/auth/src/oauth-client.ts

Migration Steps:
1. Create package export
2. Update Bingo imports
3. Update Trivia imports
4. Delete duplicate files
5. Verify tests pass
```

#### Tracking Testing Gaps

For test coverage issues, document:

1. **Test file** - Where tests should live
2. **Functions/components** - What needs testing
3. **Test scope** - What needs testing
4. **Current coverage** - Baseline measurement
5. **Target coverage** - Goal percentage

```yaml
# Test gap issue structure
Test File: apps/platform-hub/src/app/api/oauth/deny/__tests__/route.test.ts
Functions to Test:
- POST handler (deny authorization)
- Error handling (invalid ID, expired, already used)
- Audit logging

Current Coverage: 0%
Target Coverage: 80%
Test Scope: Comprehensive coverage of all handler paths
```
