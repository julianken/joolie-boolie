# Manual Test Plan — Joolie Boolie

The canonical guide for manual QA using **Playwright MCP browser tools**. Covers visual, audio, and interactive flows that automated E2E tests cannot.

For automated E2E tests, see [docs/E2E_TESTING_GUIDE.md](E2E_TESTING_GUIDE.md).

---

## Quick Reference

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| Run all stories | Follow Prerequisites below, then walk through sections 1–5 |
| Run a single story | Search for `Story X.Y` and follow its test cases |
| Run by app | Section 1 = Bingo, Section 2 = Trivia |
| Run cross-cutting | Section 3 = A11y, Section 4 = PWA, Section 5 = Responsive |
| Report results | Update the Result column: `**PASS**`, `NOT TESTED`, or `**BUG** — description` |
| Log a new bug | Add to Bugs Found table below, file a Linear issue (BEA-###) |

**Current status:** 168 PASS, 0 BUGS, 16 NOT TESTED (standalone 2-app scope after BEA-702 cleanup)

---

## Prerequisites

### 1. Start dev servers

```bash
pnpm dev    # Starts Bingo and Trivia
```

> **NEVER use `pnpm dev:e2e` or `E2E_TESTING=true` for manual testing.** That mode is only for automated E2E test suites (`pnpm test:e2e`). Manual/Playwright MCP testing uses the normal dev mode.

| App | Default Port | URL |
|-----|-------------|-----|
| Bingo | 3000 | http://localhost:3000 |
| Trivia | 3001 | http://localhost:3001 |

> **Worktrees:** If running from `.worktrees/`, ports are hash-offset from the path. Check terminal output for actual ports. See [ADR-001](adr/ADR-001-e2e-hash-port-isolation.md).

### 2. Playwright MCP browser setup

Always launch the browser in **dark mode** (project convention):

```
browser_navigate to http://localhost:3000
browser_evaluate: page.emulateMedia({ colorScheme: 'dark' })
```

Do **not** toggle the `dark` class on `<html>` directly — the apps manage a `light`/`dark` class themselves from the theme store, and adding `dark` without removing `light` produces broken, mixed-theme styling that looks like a real bug.

### 3. Key Playwright MCP tools

| Tool | Use for |
|------|---------|
| `browser_navigate` | Go to a URL |
| `browser_snapshot` | Get page accessibility tree (preferred over screenshot for assertions) |
| `browser_click` | Click elements by text, role, or ref |
| `browser_evaluate` | Run JS in page context (DOM checks, fullscreen, offline) |
| `browser_take_screenshot` | Visual verification (theme changes, responsive layouts) |
| `browser_press_key` | Keyboard shortcuts (Space, P, R, U, M, D, E, ?, arrows) |
| `browser_fill_form` | Fill input fields |
| `browser_resize` | Test responsive breakpoints (375x667 mobile, 768x1024 tablet) |

### 4. Tips

- Use `browser_snapshot` to verify element presence — it returns the accessibility tree, which is faster and more reliable than screenshots for assertions
- Use `browser_evaluate` with `context.setOffline(true)` to test offline mode
- Use `browser_evaluate` with `document.requestFullscreen()` / `document.exitFullscreen()` for fullscreen
- Playwright Chromium doesn't inherit macOS dark mode — always use `page.emulateMedia({ colorScheme: 'dark' })`
- No authentication is required — both apps are standalone and all persistence is localStorage

> **Footnote (BEA-702, 2026-04-11):** Runs 1-9 above included Platform Hub, OAuth SSO, and template-aggregation stories (former Sections 1 and 4) that were removed in the standalone conversion (BEA-682–696). Those rows are preserved here for historical continuity. All subsequent runs cover only the 2-app standalone scope documented below.

## Bugs Found and Fixed

| ID | Severity | Description | Fix |
|----|----------|-------------|-----|
| BEA-503 | Minor | Bingo: Pattern selection doesn't persist across page refresh. | Fixed in PR #337 — pattern now serialized in localStorage |
| BEA-504 | Minor | Trivia: Teams and scores don't persist across page refresh. | Fixed in PR #339 — teams/scores now serialized in localStorage |

## Notes

- Trivia scoring controls (+/-) only appear during active gameplay (not during emergency pause)
- Presets and Question Set selectors only visible in pre-game setup area, not during gameplay
- Security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy) present on both apps
- Serwist SW registers in Turbopack dev mode via `@serwist/turbopack` — both Bingo and Trivia have active SWs
- QuestionImporter and CategoryFilter now rendered in page UI (fixed by BEA-506/BEA-507)
- Fullscreen API works in Playwright Chromium via `evaluate` (no user gesture required)
- Offline mode tested via `context.setOffline(true)` — both apps show banner and continue working
