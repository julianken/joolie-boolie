# Manual Test Plan - Joolie Boolie Platform

> **Purpose:** Human-readable test cases for manual verification using Playwright MCP browser tools.
> This supplements the ~338 automated E2E tests with interactive validation of visual, audio, and cross-app flows.
>
> **How to use:** Start dev servers (`pnpm dev`), then walk through each story using `browser_navigate`, `browser_snapshot`, `browser_click`, `browser_evaluate`, and `browser_take_screenshot`.
>
> **Last executed:** 2026-02-14 (run 6) — **156 PASS, 0 BUGS, 0 NOT TESTABLE** (from 156 test cases). Full re-run confirmed all fixes stable plus 1 newly tested (4.3 #1 fake token rejection). All 3 bugs from run 2 fixed (BEA-503, BEA-504, BEA-505). All previously NOT TESTABLE items resolved (runs 4-5).
> **Auth method:** Authenticated flows tested using `E2E_TESTING=true` mode with Playwright MCP. Login via Platform Hub with E2E credentials (`e2e-test@joolie-boolie.test` / `TestPassword123!`), cookies shared across all ports on `localhost`.

> ### Execution History
> | Date | Scope | Result |
> |------|-------|--------|
> | 2026-02-14 (run 1) | Unauthenticated flows (Sections 1, 2.1, 3.1) | 39/43 PASS, 5 NOTES |
> | 2026-02-14 (run 2) | Authenticated + remaining flows | 97 PASS, 3 BUGS, 55 NOT TESTED |
> | 2026-02-14 (run 3) | Bug fixes verified + remaining NOT TESTED | 145 PASS, 0 BUGS, 10 NOT TESTABLE |
> | 2026-02-14 (run 4) | Full re-run after BEA-506/507/508 merged (PRs #340-342) | 149 PASS, 0 BUGS, 6 NOT TESTABLE |
> | 2026-02-14 (run 5) | Resolved all 6 NOT TESTABLE items (fullscreen, templates, offline) | 155 PASS, 0 BUGS, 0 NOT TESTABLE |
> | 2026-02-14 (run 6) | Full re-run of all 155 tests + 1 newly tested (4.3 #1) | 156 PASS, 0 BUGS, 0 NOT TESTABLE |
>
> ### Bugs Found and Fixed
> | ID | Severity | Description | Fix |
> |----|----------|-------------|-----|
> | BEA-503 | Minor | Bingo: Pattern selection doesn't persist across page refresh. | Fixed in PR #337 — pattern now serialized in localStorage |
> | BEA-504 | Minor | Trivia: Teams and scores don't persist across page refresh. | Fixed in PR #339 — teams/scores now serialized in localStorage |
> | BEA-505 | Minor | Platform Hub: Profile API returns 500 for E2E users. | Fixed in PR #338 — graceful fallback for missing DB rows |
>
> ### Notes
> - Template API returns E2E fixture data (2 templates: "E2E Trivia" + "E2E Bingo Classic") in E2E mode
> - Playwright's Chromium doesn't inherit macOS dark mode; use `page.emulateMedia({ colorScheme: 'dark' })` to test System Default theme
> - Trivia scoring controls (+/-) only appear during active gameplay (not during emergency pause)
> - Presets and Question Set selectors only visible in pre-game setup area, not during gameplay
> - All security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy) present on all 3 apps
> - Serwist SW registers in Turbopack dev mode via `@serwist/turbopack` — both Bingo and Trivia have active SWs
> - Hub home page has horizontal overflow at 375px mobile viewport (pre-existing responsive issue)
> - QuestionImporter and CategoryFilter now rendered in page UI (fixed by BEA-506/BEA-507)
> - Fullscreen API works in Playwright Chromium via `evaluate` (no user gesture required)
> - Offline mode tested via `context.setOffline(true)` — both apps show banner and continue working
>
> ### Previously NOT TESTABLE, now PASS
> | Category | Tests | Resolution |
> |----------|-------|------------|
> | File upload/import (3.7 tests 2-4) | 3 | BEA-506 (PR #340) wired QuestionImporter into page UI |
> | Category filter (3.14 test 2) | 1 | BEA-507 (PR #341) wired CategoryFilter into page UI |
> | Fullscreen toggle (2.8 test 3) | 1 | Tested via `requestFullscreen()`/`exitFullscreen()` evaluate (run 5) |
> | Template aggregation (4.4 tests 1-2) | 2 | E2E store provides mock templates — API returns 200 (run 5) |
> | PWA offline mode (6.1 tests 1-3) | 3 | Serwist SW active in dev mode; tested via `context.setOffline(true)` (run 5) |

- Accessibility (keyboard nav, ARIA labels, form labels)

**Trivia E2E (~113 tests):**
- Auth flow (SSO redirect, token handling)

- Audio verification (TTS, sound effects)
- Complex multi-window interactions (dual-screen sync)
- Cross-app SSO flows end-to-end
- Edge cases in user interaction (rapid clicks, form validation)
- Responsive design at different breakpoints
- Accessibility compliance (font sizes, touch targets)
