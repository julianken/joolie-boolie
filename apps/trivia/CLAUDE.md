## Monorepo Structure

This app uses shared packages from the monorepo:
- `@joolie-boolie/sync` - Dual-screen synchronization
- `@joolie-boolie/ui` - Shared UI components (Button, Toggle, Slider)
- `@joolie-boolie/theme` - Accessible design tokens
- `@joolie-boolie/auth` - Auth utilities (token refresh, JWT verification)

## Key Commands

```bash
# From monorepo root
pnpm dev:trivia        # Start dev server on port 3001

# From apps/trivia
pnpm dev               # Start dev server
pnpm build             # Build trivia app
pnpm test              # Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:run          # Run tests once
pnpm test:coverage     # Run tests with coverage
```

## Game Mechanics (MVP)

- **Format:** 2-6 rounds (configurable), 3-10 questions per round
- **Question Types:** Multiple choice, True/False (MVP only)
- **Timing:** 30 seconds default (configurable), optional auto-start
- **Scoring:** Hybrid - presenter records team answers, auto-scored
- **Correct Answers:** Can be amended on-the-fly with automatic re-scoring
- **Teams:** Up to 20 teams, default "Table N" naming (renameable)
- **Emergency Pause:** Blanks audience display for emergencies

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Arrow Up/Down | Navigate questions |
| Space | Peek answer (local only, not shown on display) |
| D | Toggle display question on audience |
| P | Pause/Resume game |
| E | Emergency pause (blanks audience display) |
| R | Reset game |

## Design Requirements

- **Accessible:** Large fonts (min 18px), high contrast, large click targets (min 44x44px)
- **Dual-screen:** Presenter dashboard + audience projection
- **Accessible:** Keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Offline-capable:** PWA with service worker

## Testing

Tests are located alongside the code in `__tests__` directories:
- `stores/__tests__/` - Store tests
- `hooks/__tests__/` - Hook tests
- `components/**/__tests__/` - Component tests

Run with:
```bash
pnpm test             # Watch mode
pnpm test:run         # Single run
pnpm test:coverage    # With coverage
```

## Completed Features

- ✅ Question import from file (CSV/JSON) - Full parser with drag-drop UI
- ✅ Question categories - 7 predefined categories with filtering UI
- ✅ Saved game templates - Complete CRUD API + template selector UI
- ✅ User authentication - OAuth 2.1 with middleware protection

## Future Work (TODO)

- [ ] Question timer with auto-reveal
- [ ] Analytics/history tracking
