# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Trivia** - A presenter-controlled trivia system for groups and communities. Part of the Joolie Boolie monorepo.

**Current State:** Fully functional with team management, rounds, scoring, TTS, buzz-in, timer auto-reveal, question sets, presets, themes, and dual-screen sync.

## Architecture Notes

- **BFF Pattern:** Frontend never talks directly to Supabase. All requests go through API routes.
- **Game Engine:** Pure functions in `lib/game/engine.ts` transform `GameState`. Zustand store wraps these for React integration.
- **Buzz-In:** `lib/game/buzz-in.ts` handles buzz-in logic, exposed via `hooks/use-buzz-in.ts`
- **Timer:** `hooks/use-timer-auto-reveal.ts` manages countdown and auto-reveal behavior
- **Questions:** `lib/questions/` contains parser, validator, converter, exporter, and types for question import/export
- **Auth:** OAuth 2.1 via Platform Hub. OAuth client utilities in `lib/auth/` (oauth-client.ts, pkce.ts). Middleware-based JWT verification with lazy JWKS initialization.
- **Sync:** Session sync wrapper in `lib/sync/session.ts`, built on `@joolie-boolie/sync`

## Design Requirements

- **Accessible:** Large fonts (min 18px), high contrast, large click targets (min 44x44px)
- **Dual-screen:** Presenter dashboard + audience projection
- **Keyboard navigation:** Full keyboard support with shortcuts
- **Offline-capable:** PWA with service worker

## Testing

Tests are located alongside code in `__tests__` directories:
- `stores/__tests__/` - Store tests
- `hooks/__tests__/` - Hook tests
- `components/**/__tests__/` - Component tests

```bash
pnpm test             # Watch mode
pnpm test:run         # Single run
pnpm test:coverage    # With coverage
```

## Game Mechanics

- **Format:** 2-6 rounds (configurable), 3-10 questions per round
- **Question Types:** Multiple choice, True/False
- **Timing:** 30 seconds default (configurable), optional auto-start, auto-reveal
- **Scoring:** Hybrid - presenter records team answers, auto-scored
- **Correct Answers:** Can be amended on-the-fly with automatic re-scoring
- **Teams:** Up to 20 teams, default "Table N" naming (renameable)
- **Emergency Pause:** Blanks audience display for emergencies

## Future Work (TODO)

- [ ] Analytics/history tracking
