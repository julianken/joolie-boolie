# 🚨 CRITICAL: Workflow 🚨

## ⚠️ YOU MUST USE `Skill(subagent-workflow)` FOR ALL MULTI-STEP WORK ⚠️

**THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL. THIS IS THE CORE WORKFLOW.**

### When to Use (ALWAYS for multi-step work)

✅ **ANY task with implementation plan**
✅ **ANY task with multiple steps**
✅ **ANY coding work beyond trivial single-line fixes**

### The Workflow Enforces

1. **Linear Integration** - Query Linear for issue context BEFORE starting work
2. **Parallel Task Execution** - Run independent tasks concurrently in separate worktrees
3. **Sequential Per-Task Reviews** - Each task goes through: Implementer → Spec Review → Quality Review
4. **Status Tracking** - Update Linear at every stage (Backlog → Todo → In Progress → In Review → Done)
5. **PR Mechanics** - Create PRs, get reviews, merge in dependency order

### Skip ONLY for

❌ Single-line typo fixes
❌ Pure research tasks (no code changes)
❌ Reading files to answer questions

**Everything else MUST use `Skill(subagent-workflow)`.**

### Quick Reference

```bash
# Invoke the skill
Skill(subagent-workflow)

# The skill will guide you through:
# Step 0: GET WORK FROM LINEAR (mandatory)
# Step 1: Plan parallel work
# Step 2: Create git worktrees (isolation)
# Step 3: Dispatch implementer agents
# Step 4: Dispatch spec reviewers
# Step 5: Dispatch quality reviewers
# Step 6: Merge and integrate
```

### Why This Matters

- **Quality:** Two-stage review (spec + quality) catches issues early
- **Traceability:** Linear integration provides full audit trail
- **Speed:** Parallel execution is faster than sequential
- **Isolation:** Worktrees prevent conflicts
- **Discipline:** Prevents rushed, incomplete work

# 🚨 CRITICAL: E2E Testing 🚨

## ⚠️ ALL CODE MUST PASS E2E TESTS LOCALLY BEFORE COMMITTING ⚠️

**GitHub Actions are DISABLED to avoid billing costs. Local E2E validation is MANDATORY.**

```bash
pnpm test:e2e              # Build apps + run all tests
pnpm test:e2e:summary      # Show pass/fail counts (ALWAYS check this)
```

**If E2E tests fail: DO NOT COMMIT. Fix the code first.**

See [docs/E2E_TESTING_GUIDE.md](docs/E2E_TESTING_GUIDE.md) for full details: commands, checklist, port isolation, troubleshooting, and workflow integration.

## Project Overview

**Beak Gaming Platform** - A unified gaming platform for retirement communities, featuring Bingo, Trivia, and future games. Built as a Turborepo monorepo with shared packages.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Development Model

**This project is developed EXCLUSIVELY with AI agents (Claude Code).**

**NEVER include:**
- ❌ Time estimates (weeks, days, hours, sprints)
- ❌ Effort estimates (man-hours, engineer-days)
- ❌ Team size assumptions (number of developers)
- ❌ Timeline projections ("Week 1-2", "Phase 1: 3 weeks")
- ❌ Resource planning ("1 frontend dev + 1 backend dev")

**Why:** All work is done by AI agents, not human developers on schedules. Time-based planning is meaningless in this context.

**Instead, focus on:**
- ✅ Dependencies (what blocks what)
- ✅ Complexity (simple, medium, complex)
- ✅ Scope (number of tasks)
- ✅ Critical path (order of execution)
- ✅ Completion status (done vs. remaining)

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Issue Tracking 🚨

**THIS PROJECT USES LINEAR FOR ISSUE TRACKING - NOT GITHUB ISSUES**

### ❌ NEVER Use GitHub Issues

- ❌ DO NOT search GitHub issues (`mcp__plugin_github_github__search_issues`)
- ❌ DO NOT create GitHub issues (`mcp__plugin_github_github__issue_write`)
- ❌ DO NOT list GitHub issues (`mcp__plugin_github_github__list_issues`)

### ✅ ALWAYS Use Linear MCP

When asked about issues, tasks, or work tracking:

```bash
# List open issues
mcp__linear-server__list_issues

# Get issue details
mcp__linear-server__get_issue

# Create new issue
mcp__linear-server__create_issue

# Update existing issue
mcp__linear-server__update_issue
```

### Issue Identifier Format

Linear issues use the format: `BEA-###` (e.g., BEA-319, BEA-320)

**NOT GitHub format:** `#123` or `owner/repo#123`

### Why This Matters

- **All project tracking is in Linear** - GitHub issues are not monitored
- **Issue references in code** use Linear IDs (BEA-###)
- **Workflow integration** is with Linear, not GitHub

## Commands

```bash
pnpm install              # Install dependencies
pnpm dev                  # Run all apps
pnpm dev:bingo            # Run bingo only
pnpm dev:trivia           # Run trivia only
pnpm dev:hub              # Run platform-hub only
pnpm build                # Build all apps and packages
pnpm test                 # Run all tests
pnpm lint                 # Lint all apps and packages
pnpm clean                # Clean all build artifacts
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# From app directory (e.g., apps/bingo)
pnpm test                 # Watch mode
pnpm test:run             # Single run
pnpm test:coverage        # With coverage report

# Run specific test file
pnpm vitest src/lib/game/__tests__/engine.test.ts
```

### Pre-Commit Hooks

**Automatic Quality Checks:** Husky + lint-staged run checks on every commit to catch issues early.

**What runs automatically:**
- `pnpm lint` - ESLint checks on changed packages
- `pnpm typecheck` - TypeScript type checking on changed packages
- `pnpm test:run` - Unit tests on changed packages

**Why:** GitHub Actions were disabled to avoid billing overages. Pre-commit hooks replace CI checks with local validation.

**Bypass when needed:**
```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "WIP: bypass hooks for work-in-progress"
```

**How it works:**
- Uses Turborepo's `--filter=[HEAD^1]` to only check changed packages
- Turbo's caching makes repeated runs instant
- Build validation still happens in Vercel CI (free unlimited builds)

**Configuration:**
- Hooks: `.husky/pre-commit`
- Lint-staged: `.lintstagedrc.js`
- Installed via: `prepare` script in `package.json` (runs automatically on `pnpm install`)

## Architecture

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for BFF pattern, dual-screen system, game engine pattern, and app structure.

See [docs/APP_STRUCTURE.md](docs/APP_STRUCTURE.md) for canonical `lib/` layout with common vs app-specific directories.

## Middleware Patterns

See [docs/MIDDLEWARE_PATTERNS.md](docs/MIDDLEWARE_PATTERNS.md) for critical Next.js middleware rules (lazy initialization, JWKS caching).

## Design Requirements

- **Senior-friendly:** Large fonts (min 18px body), high contrast, large click targets (min 44x44px)
- **Audience display:** Optimized for projector/large TV, readable from back of room
- **Keyboard shortcuts:** See app-specific CLAUDE.md files for keyboard shortcuts

## Keyboard Shortcuts

### Bingo
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Space | Roll next ball |
| P | Pause/Resume |
| R | Reset game |
| U | Undo last call |
| M | Mute audio |

### Trivia
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Arrow Up/Down | Navigate questions |
| Space | Peek answer (local only) |
| D | Toggle display question |
| P | Pause/Resume |
| E | Emergency pause |
| R | Reset game |

## Environment Variables

Create `.env.local` in each app:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key

# Session Token Secret (for HMAC-signed JWT tokens)
# Generate with: openssl rand -hex 32
SESSION_TOKEN_SECRET=your-64-character-hex-string

# Redis (Optional - platform-hub only, for production rate limiting)
# Required for multi-instance deployments to share rate limit state
# If not set, rate limiting falls back to in-memory (single instance only)
# Get from: https://console.upstash.com/
REDIS_URL=https://your-redis-instance.upstash.io
REDIS_TOKEN=your-redis-token
```

## Pull Request Template

**IMPORTANT:** All pull requests MUST use the template at `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.

When creating PRs:
1. Read the template file first: `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
2. Fill in all required sections (Five-Level Explanation is mandatory)
3. Complete the Testing checklist
4. Add diagrams/screenshots if relevant

The template includes:
- Human Summary (2-4 bullets)
- Five-Level Explanation (required: non-technical → deep technical)
- Changes, Testing, Risk/Impact, Notes for Reviewers

## App-Specific Context

Each app has its own CLAUDE.md with detailed context:
- `apps/bingo/CLAUDE.md` - 75-ball bingo, 29 patterns, game mechanics
- `apps/trivia/CLAUDE.md` - Team trivia, rounds, scoring (15 sample questions)
- `apps/platform-hub/CLAUDE.md` - Auth, game selector, dashboard
